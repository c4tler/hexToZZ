I wrote these two functions during a security project where I had to convert between hex and zz values.
Originally I thought there would already be a function to do this in NTL but after considerable searching, could not find such function.
After looking online for an example a function that might do this and not finding anything, I decided to write my own.
I figured next time someone like me went looking for something like this my code might be useful to them.
